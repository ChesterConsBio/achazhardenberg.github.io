As part of my PhD I want to investigate the kinship of long-finned pilot whales involved in mass stranding events, of which there have been six in Scotland and Ireland since 2010. In order to do this, we planned to use microsatellite loci (microsats) to distinguish between individuals and identify parent and offspring relations. An opportunity arose to visit one of the research labs at Aberystwyth University, with Dr Niall McKeown who has been collecting kinship data from mass stranding events in the Falklands. It was an exciting prospect to experience working in a different lab and with someone who has successfully used the techniques, so I jumped at the chance to ensure that the data collection for my samples would go smoothly.

I arrived with my samples at the beginning of November 2019 (which felt like the first day of school all over again!), I had a welcome chat/grilling with Niall and the other researchers, [Ilze Skuji≈Üa](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilze_Skujina2), [Amy Healey](https://twitter.com/amyhealey91) and [Sophie de Becquevort](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophie_De_Becquevort), that I would be sharing the lab with during my months placement. This was followed by an introduction to the procedures and techniques from Niall and then I got stuck straight into preparing a subset of my samples ready to start trials the next day. After testing 22 different microsats and sending the best 16 of those for sequencing, we settled on 13 microsat loci that had clear, clean and variable allele results to run all my samples with. After several days of continuous PCR, the multiplex (more than one microsat per sample) plates for all my samples were sent off to be sequenced.

A great bonus of completing this lab work at Aberystwyth University is that they can sequence DNA on site, which is a much faster process than sending the samples off to an external company for sequencing. As the sequencing was completed Niall introduced me to the fine art that is identifying allele peaks, in the analysis software Peak Scanner. Determining allele shapes and sizes is an incredibly tedious yet satisfying procedure that took over my almost every waking moment for the following days! After scoring all the allele peaks, I identified any samples that consistently did not amplify across the different microsats to repeat and then an additional random 10% of samples to repeat in order to check the error rates during analysis. I then repeated the PCR process for these samples and set up new multiplex plates to be sequenced and my work in the lab was done! The month flew by, in part because I was busy in the lab or processing the results to ensure I was finished within the timeframe but, also because of the brilliant welcome, support and friendship of the researchers I was with.

I did also manage to leave the lab at weekends and explore the local area, big thanks to Amy, Ilze, Sophie and Rowan for showing me around. We had a brilliant hike up Aran Fawddwy (tallest mountain in south Snowdonia) despite walking 90% of the route in cloud with zero views to look at! I took a trip to see the red kites being fed at Bwlch Nant Yr Arian and explored the nature reserve at Ynyslas. Although, I did keep my eyes on the sea as much as possible to try and see the bottlenose dolphins of Cardigan Bay which I was told frequent Aberystwyth I did not manage to see fin nor flipper of them!
