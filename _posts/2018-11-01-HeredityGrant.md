_PhD student, Kate Peters, has received a competitive grant from the Genetics Society that will benefit conservation of a species at risk of extinction_
 
Kate Peters has been awarded a Â£1500 Heredity Fieldwork Grant from the Genetics Society. This grant will support field-based genetics research in Grenada in the Caribbean. Non-invasive samples in the form of moulted feathers will be collected to support on-going research into the application of genetic techniques for the conservation of the critically endangered Grenada dove (_Leptotila wellsi_). This species is endemic to Grenada and has a current population size of approximately 160 individuals. The species exists in three seemingly isolated populations. This grant will allow samples to be collected from all three known populations. DNA will be extracted from these samples and genetic diversity and connectivity will be assessed. To date this project is the first genetic research to be conducted on this critically endangered species.
