_PhD student, Rachel Ball, receives a competitive University of Chester postgraduate bursary to support her work on cetacean conservation around the British Isles._

New PhD student, Rachel Ball, will be working with Dr Anna Muir, Dr Matt Geary and Dr Ian McDowall of the University of Chester Biological Sciences Department to assess the conservation status of long finned pilot whales (_Globicephala melas_).

This project will work in collaboration with the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) and Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG), and will benefit from the expertise of cetacean ecologist Dr Simon Berrow of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.

The project will use cutting edge techniques in seascape genomics and population modeling to assess conservation status, population structure, relatedness in mass stranding events, and adaptation to environmental parameters to help safeguard the future of this data deficient species.
