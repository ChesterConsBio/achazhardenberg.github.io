Two PhD students within the department, Rachel Ball and Kate Peters, have been successful in receiving funding to attend the Population Genetics Group (PopGroup) 52 meeting in Oxford at the start of 2019. They will present posters about their research assessing the population structure of long-finned pilot whales around the British Isles and the conservation genetics of the endangered Grenada dove, respectively. We hope they have a great conference!
