PhD student Kate Peters has recently published her first paper titled ‘A novel method to optimise the utility of underused moulted plumulaceous feather samples for genetic analysis in bird conservation’ in the journal Conservation Genetics Resources. 

The focus of Kate's PhD is conservation of the Grenada dove (Leptotila wellsi) using genetic techniques. This is a critically endangered species and therefore the project relies on non-invasive samples found and collected opportunistically in the field. These samples are largely comprised of naturally moulted plumulaceous feather samples which have been kept in a hot and humid environment all of which are not optimal for samples intended for genetic analysis. As a result, part of Kate’s PhD research was to adapt existing DNA extraction and amplification methods in order to optimise the genetic utility of these samples. The new optimised method significantly increases the concentration of DNA extracted from plumulaceous feather samples along with improving the quality of amplified DNA. This paper provides evidence that samples collected non-invasively in the field and kept in non-optimal conditions for DNA extraction can be used effectively to sequence a 650bp region of mtDNA for genetic analysis.
