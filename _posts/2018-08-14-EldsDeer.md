_Dr Anna Muir receives collaboration funding from WWF to assess the conservation genetics of the endangered Eld’s deer in Cambodia._

A new project has recently launched within the Department of Biological Sciences, using conservation genetics to assess population status and local extinction risk in the endangered Eld’s deer (Rucervus eldii). Dr Anna Muir has been granted £10,000 of collaboration funding by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to assess the conservation genetics of this rare and cryptic species within the Eastern Plains of Cambodia.

Eld’s deer are endangered worldwide and are at such low numbers in Cambodia that traditional survey techniques cannot accurately assess population size. The project, which commenced this month, is using faecal samples collected in the field as a non-invasive source material from which DNA can be extracted to assess population isolation, genetic diversity and number of individuals. 

The outputs from this project will be used by WWF in Cambodia to form conservation management plans for the species and to work with the Cambodian government to ensure adequate protection of the Eld’s deer to ensure their future survival.
