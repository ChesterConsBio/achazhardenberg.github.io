At the start of 2019, Dr Anna Muir and PhD students, Kate Peters and Rachel Ball, attended the 52nd Population Genetics Group meeting in Oxford to present their research, to hear about cutting-edge research taking place across the country, and to develop collaborations.

Anna presented a talk entitled “Seascape genomics of a reef-building ecosystem engineer”, Kate presented a poster on “Phylogenetic analysis of the critically endangered Grenada dove” and Rachel presented a poster discussing “Phylogeography of long-finned pilot whales stranded around the British Isles, with evidence of new haplotypes”.

It was a very interesting conference that brought together researchers from across the UK as well as internationally and led to very interesting discussions about future research plans.
