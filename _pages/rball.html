<h1>Novel techniques for informing conservation of difficult to observe species: Long-finned pilot whales (<i>Globicephala melas</i>) around the British Isles.</h1>
<h3 id="about-rachel">About Rachel</h3>
<p>I am interested in the marine environment, specifically cetaceans. I grew up in the Lake District which is where my love of the natural world, wildlife and conservation stems from. Studying genetics lets you delve into the hidden world of that species, finding out so much more detail than from observation alone, providing information to help best conserve that species. When I am not in the lab I like to be out exploring either in the mountains or on the coast.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to use conservation genomics and population modelling to assess the conservation status and behavioural ecology of long-finned pilot whales around the British Isles. Sampling is non-invasive using skin or muscle tissues taken post-mortem from individuals that had stranded around the coasts of Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands. There haven been six mass stranding events in the past ten years, two in Ireland and four in Scotland. Long-finned pilot whales are presumed to travel in maternal pods of only related individuals, to test this theory we will examine the kinship found within in each event. Across the study area we are looking to determine if there is any population structure and/or local adaptation and how that relates to the environments surrounding the British Isles. Additionally, we will model the distribution and habitat preferences of long-finned pilot whales, from sighting survey data, and how they may be influenced by a changing climate. The outputs of these analyses will lead to conservation recommendations for long-finned pilot whales around the British Isles, helping to ensure the future survival of this species.</p></div>
