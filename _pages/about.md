We are the Conservation Biology Research Group at the University of Chester. Our members have expertise in conservation genetics, population and landscape ecology, conservation policy and marine ecology. Our focus lies in combining these areas of research to inform the conservation of species, ecosystems and landscapes. We have projects around the globe, including Europe, the Caribbean, South East Asia and South America. However, we also maintain a local focus with conservation projects in Cheshire and North Wales as well as other locations in the UK and Ireland. Another focus of our research is cross-disciplinary projects with the other main research areas in the department where possible.
